# OOICX - Objective Observer Initiative Code Experience

## Overview

OOICX (**Objective Observer Initiative Code Experience**) is an open-source framework designed to enable objective, high-reciprocity system states and teleological constructs within digital ecosystems. It provides the foundational components required to facilitate agreements and foster transparency in the generation and propagation of public interest data.

By adhering to a strict principle of **objective observation**, OOICX enables individuals, organizations, and decentralized networks to interact, record, and structure information with clear intent. The framework supports distributed and extensible development while ensuring that core system state functions remain open, verifiable, and beneficial to all participants.

## Core Principles

- **Objective Observation**: All interactions within the system are captured as neutral, verifiable events, ensuring traceability without subjective bias.
- **High Reciprocity**: The foundational system state functions and teleological constructs operate under a **strong copyleft model (AGPL-3.0)** to guarantee continued openness.
- **Intent-Based Licensing**: Extensions, innovations, and data streams generated through the initiative may adopt diverse licensing models, provided that their intended commercialization or usage is disclosed to observed participants and formed under the system state definition of 'observable agreements'.
- **Distributed and Extensible**: Developers can build on OOICX with modular components, fostering a diverse ecosystem of tools, plugins, and services.

## Licensing Model

OOICX adopts a **tiered licensing structure**:

- **Core Framework (AGPL-3.0)**: All system state functions and teleological constructs that define agreement-making and observer integrity must remain open-source and freely available.
- **Extensions and Plugins (Flexible Licensing)**: Independent developers and organizations may release add-ons, tools, and non-core functionalities under **MIT, Apache-2.0, proprietary, or other licenses** as long as their intent is transparently declared.
- **Public Interest Data (Intent-Based Licensing)**: Any data generated through interactions with OOICX must explicitly state its licensing terms and potential commercial use before being collected or processed.

By maintaining **AGPL-3.0 as the foundation**, the initiative safeguards the core mission while allowing room for innovation and commercialization where appropriate.

## Getting Started

-- Right now, this project is just getting started. Everything below is indicative and for illustrative reference alone. To learn more of this project, please follow the OOISX sub-initiative via https://opendata.ly.

### Prerequisites

To contribute or use OOICX, youâ€™ll need:
- **Python 3.10+** (for core services)
- **Node.js 18+** (for UI components and interactions)
- **Docker** (optional, for rapid deployment)

### Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/OOICX.git
cd OOICX
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the core observer service:

```sh
python observer.py
```

For frontend development:

```sh
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch.
2. **Ensure compatibility with the core system state functions** if modifying core functionality.
3. **Adhere to licensing constraints** (extensions must declare their chosen license model).
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of the changes and intent.

By contributing, you agree to abide by the **high reciprocity principle** of OOICX.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Deploy the initial AGPL-licensed observer framework
- [ ] Establish core governance and agreement mechanisms
- [ ] Provide APIs for modular and distributed component integration
- [ ] Implement intent-based licensing structures for data generation
- [ ] Engage with open-source and public interest communities

## Acknowledgments

This project is part of the broader **OpenData.AI** initiative (OOIOX), striving to create **a trustable, open, and verifiable data ecosystem** that aligns with human and institutional agency.

- OX: **objective experience** is represented by instrumentation that will form from a start of authority model located at opendata.ai
- CX: **code experience** is represented by this project and the practitioner discussions formed by developers and contributors.
- SX: **social experience** is represented by those that opt into the concepts related to building social capital via agency oriented value operations.

ðŸš€ **OOICX is a foundation, not a final form.** The initiative invites all contributors to help shape and extend its impactâ€”while ensuring the integrity of its observer state remains intact. Letâ€™s build the future of public interest data together!
